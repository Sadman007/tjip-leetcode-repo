Explanation : 

As our target is to gain the maximum Profit <br>
in that case we always wan to buy stock at lower price and sell at maximum price; <br>
so our job is to find smallest price before the maximum price <br>
for that reason, We took 2 variables and declare them as startPrice and maxProfit<br>
maxProfit will be the last highest price and start price will be the lowest price before it ;<br><br>

then we run a for loop through our given prices array and when got a lower price we have just updated the startPrice and then for every price we tried to find max profit ;
<br>
thats how our solution have come and its took only  <br>
O(1) memory<br>
and O(n) time !!<br>
